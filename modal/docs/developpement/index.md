# Development

## List of npm installations
To get started with development, you need to install the following dependencies using npm:

```
$ npm i --save react react-dom react-scripts @fortawesome/fontawesome-svg-core @fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons @fortawesome/react-fontawesome
```

Make sure to run this command in your project directory. It will install React, ReactDOM, React Scripts, as well as the necessary Font Awesome free icons for your modal.

## List of npm commands
Here is a list of commonly used npm commands in the development of your application:

- `npm start`: This command starts your application in development mode. It opens a development server and automatically refreshes the page when you make changes in the source code. Use this command while you're working on your application.

Make sure not to commit the build files to your repository. These files are typically generated when you deploy your application and should not be included in your version control.

Happy coding!
