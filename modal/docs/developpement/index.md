## Dependencies
Dependencies are essential packages and libraries required for your application to function correctly. They provide specific functionalities and features. Here's an overview of the dependencies added to your project:

### 1. Font Awesome
- **@fortawesome/fontawesome-svg-core**: A library that provides the core functionality for Font Awesome's vector icons.
- **@fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons**: A collection of free solid vector icons from Font Awesome.
- **@fortawesome/react-fontawesome**: A React wrapper for using Font Awesome icons in your application.

### 2. Testing Library
- **@testing-library/jest-dom**: A package containing Jest test utilities for performing DOM assertions.
- **@testing-library/react**: A testing library that simplifies testing React components by providing methods to interact with the virtual DOM.
- **@testing-library/user-event**: A package that offers user event simulation methods for testing with Testing Library.

### 3. React
- **react**: The core React library for building user interfaces.
- **react-dom**: The library responsible for rendering React components into the browser's DOM.

## npm commands
Here is a list of commonly used npm commands during the development of your application:

- `npm install`: This command installs all the dependencies listed in your project's package.json file.
- `npm start`: This command starts your application in development mode. It opens a development server and automatically refreshes the page whenever you make changes to the source code. Use this command while actively working on your application.

Ensure that you do not commit the build files to your repository. These files are typically generated when you deploy your application and should not be included in version control.

Happy coding!
